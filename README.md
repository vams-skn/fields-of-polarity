# Fields of Polarity

**[Fields of Polarity](https://vams-skn.itch.io/fields-of-polarity)** is a interactive and story-driven game set on the planet of 'Solaria' - where polarity plays a vital role in shaping its environment.

Players must read the journal entries of Dr. Dave Morgan and solve puzzles to uncover the way back to Earth.

**Fields of Polarity** was built for the [Winter MelonJam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/wmj2024) with the theme of 'POLARITY'.

Solaria is a planet with unique magnetic and temporal fields. As a student of The National Astronauts Institute, you must solve read through Dr Dave Morgan's journals, play a series of puzzles that simulate the conditions on Solaria and navigate clues to uncover the truth about Solaria’s fields of polarity.
